Project 3 - Openclassrooms

This project is from my Openclassrooms Full-stack Developer path : https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/104-full-stack-developer

The main acquired skills are :
- write a project brief,
- choose an appropriate technical solution,
- detail project specifications,
- list functionalities requested by the client.

The project brief is a document including anything we can find on a project brief: summary, stakeholders, goals, budget, timeline, technical
specifications (explanation of design and technical choices that were made, even if they're basic).

For this project, no WordPress allowed. I had to build the website from scratch with a text editor. It was the first time I used a text
editor and the one I chose was Sublime Text. 

It was a great opportunity to use for the first time real HTML, CSS and especially Bootstrap. It wouldn't be too much to say that I fell 
in love with Bootstrap. Its use is so clear for a total beginner in coding and the results are great with just a few lines of code.
